# MYJar
Our small app helps  a user to choose a habit and be notified to remember to do it in their day. User can  every day write (Today, I'm grateful for) or (The best thing today).
# Challenge Statement
(Make an inclusive solution that help users in bullet journal) 

If you see, we started our big idea with bullet journal. As we search, we will find out that journaling is very useful for people in many ways. We wanted to let the user has the best journal experience with us. So, as we go through work and our CBL, we decided to force in one of the journal parts the tracking habits and choose the health habits, which you will see in the (Solution Concept).


# Solution Concept

(Provide ways for users to remember their daily habits).
We wanted to make it easy for users to remember their daily habits using the best ways as if they were using a journal. We focused on health because it's one of the most important sides of our daily basis.

# Technologies & Tools
SwiftUI 
UserNotifications
# App Demo
you will see that user can choose which habit want to be notified and also make it dynamic font accessible.
